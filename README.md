# Wiki Utilities[<img src="https://weblate.frisk.space/widgets/wiki-utilities/-/svg-badge.svg" alt="Translations" align="right" />](#translations)
Wiki Utilities is a Discord bot, which allows wiki (think Fandom, Wikipedia) admins to take administrative actions, such as deleting, moving, protecting pages and more, through Discord. As Wiki Utilities requires credentials, it is a self-hosted bot, meaning you need to host it yourself to use it.

### Features
* Blocking users.
* Listing pages in a category.
* Deleting pages.
* Editing pages.
* Moving (i.e. renaming) pages.
* Modifying the protection levels of pages.
* Undeleting (i.e. restoring) pages.
* Multilingual, currently supporting [these languages](#translations) ([add more!](https://weblate.frisk.space/projects/wiki-utilities/bot/)).
* Integration with [RcGcDw](https://gitlab.com/piotrex43/RcGcDw/) (see [#110](https://gitlab.com/piotrex43/RcGcDw/-/issues/110)), allowing admins to lazily react to log messages with emojis, to either block the user, revert the edit, or delete the page.

### Setup
See [the wiki](https://github.com/lavgup/Wiki-Utilities/wiki) for setting up and configuring Wiki Utilities.
